# Angular reactiveForm example project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

This was built to give an example of using angulars form system to do input and validation

no tests were done in this, and it was built with a 'fake' async call to represent loading data from a server into the forms.
